# Puppet Webadmin

The webadmin puppet module is a module provided by [Zivtech](http://zivtech.com) which sets up the system wide defaults for a website administrative user that we think reasonable for day to day production use.

The module is well tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and CentOS 6 but pull requests that would add support for other systems are more than welcome.

## Requirements

This module requires the [puppetlabs/stdlib](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib).

## License

The puppet module is provided under the GPL version 2 license, see LICENSE.txt in this repository for more.
